## Setup (Pre-Workshop)

It is vitally important that your R and Rstudio installations are running before we commence.
Instructions for performing this are available [here]().
Please ensure you have everything installed and running correctly **BEFORE Tuesday 19th September**

Failure to have a working installation prior to the workshop will not only *limit the amount you can learn*, but will also **limit what others can learn** from the session, as we lose time trying to fix your machine.
Importantly, **installing R on a managed device can be unpredictably difficult or easy**.
Please assume you have a difficult device and prepare early.

If you require assistance, we are more than happy to help resolve any issues.
Staff are available to help you with your installation between 2-5pm, Monday 18th September at Telethon Kids Institute, 108 North Tce, Adelaide.
Otherwise, please [email for help](mailto:stephen.pederson@telethonkids.org.au)

If you are unable to get an installation working on your own laptop, please sign-up for a free account at [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)
