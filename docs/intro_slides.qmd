# Introduction {background-color="#3c3c44"}

---

We would like to acknowledge that today we're meeting on Kaurna Country. 
We acknowledge the deep feelings of attachment and relationship of the Kaurna people to their Place.

We also pay respects to the cultural authority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from other areas of Australia online today, and pay our respects to Elders past, present and emerging. 

. . .

As a scientist, I'm honoured to be working with many Indigenous Australians, who have a proud history of being some of the first scientists.

Much of today is inspired by a two-day developers workshop I attended with Hadley Wickham.
Also gave me an opportunity to have some great conversations with Winston Chang

# R {background-color="#3c3c44" background-image=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/512px-R_logo.svg.png background-size="60%" background-opacity="0.5"}


## Why use R?

- Heavily used for analysis of biological data (along with Python)
    - Can handle extremely large datasets  
    - Packages explicitly designed for complex analysis
    - Huge user base of biological researchers (www.bioconductor.org)
    - (Can be) very fast
- Very easy to *dynamically interact* with large datasets
    - Can also run as scripts on HPC clusters


::: {.notes}
I regularly work with data containing millions of lines
:::

## Why use R? 

- Avoids common Excel pitfalls
    + We (almost) never modify files on disk!
- Makes communicating results simple
    + Write presentations, books, webpages & papers
- **Reproducible Research!!!**
    - Transparent methods
    - Excellent integration with version control such as `git`
    - Version controlled code is **equivalent to a lab book**
    
. . .     
    
Experience is the best teacher $\implies$ please practice your skills

## What is R?

- First appeared in 1993
- Derivative of `S` (*John Chambers et al*, Bell Labs 1976)
- **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman (U of Auckland)
    + Ross Ihaka is of NZ Maori descent
- Authors wrote for their own research and students
- Now estimated >2 million users
    
## What is R?

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width='75%'}

- Open source language
    + No corporate ownership $\implies$ free software
    + Code is managed & improved by the community of users
- `R` is formally run by a volunteer committee (**R Core**)
    + Mostly academics
    + John Chambers is *still* a member
- Annual release schedule with patches as required

::: {.notes}
- Being open source creates headaches for University & Business IT departments
- No guarantees of being virus free
- The community self-regulates
- Even I found a bug in R 4.3.0

## What is R?

- Packages are the key to R's flexibility and power
    - Are collections of related functions
    - `ggplot2` $\implies$ Generating plots
    - `edgeR` $\implies$ Analysing RNA-Seq data
    
. . .    
    
- Packages are stored on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org)
    - Not curated for statistical quality or documentation
    - Automated testing for successful installation

. . .

- Bioconductor is a secondary repository (https://www.bioconductor.org)
    - Packages have a more biological/genomics focus
    - Curated for language consistency & documentation
   
## Where is R used?

- Google, ATO, ABS etc
- Very large community of users in finance (Dirk Eddelbuettel - `Rcpp`)
- Genomics, Ecological Research, Public Health, Physics...
- Strong integration with HPC systems like Amazon, Hadoop
- Growing Machine Learning capacity
- Even has it's own peer-reviewed Journal (The R Journal)


::: {.notes}
- I was offered a position by the ABS in 2022 specifically for my R skills to use analysing the housing market.
- BODL offered me a position the exact same day so I stayed in academia

# RStudio {background-color="#3c3c44" background-image=https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RStudio-Logo-Flat.png background-size="60%" background-opacity="0.5"}

## Introduction to RStudio

- `R` and `RStudio` are **two separate but connected things**
    + `R` is like the engine of your car
    + `RStudio` is the 'cabin' we use to control the engine
    + `RStudio` even comes with extra features not related to `R`
- `R` *does all the calculations, manages the data, generates plots*
- `RStudio` *helps manage our code, display the plots etc*

::: {.notes}
Demonstrate the old-school R terminal first
:::

## What is RStudio

- RStudio is product of a **for profit** company (Posit)
    + RStudio (Desktop) is free
    + RStudio Server has annual licence fee of \$'000s
- RStudio $\implies$ an *Integrated Development Environment* (IDE)
    + Other IDE options also exist (e.g. emacs, VSCode)
- Posit employs many of the best & brightest package developers (`tidyverse`, `bookdown`, `reticulate`, `roxygen2` etc)

::: {.notes}
- I remember being at the launch of RStudio (Coventry, 2011). It was a room full of R programmers thinking "holy crap, this changes everything"
- RStudio/Posit is a corporation whilst R is an academic-led volunteer community. So far relatively good relationship
:::

## Some very helpful features of `RStudio`

- We can write scripts and **execute code** interactively
- Auto-completion by hitting the `<tab>` key
- Use of `R Projects` to manage code/data for each project/analysis
- We can see **everything** we need (directories, plots, code, history etc.)
- Integration with markdown, $\LaTeX$, bash, python, C++, version control software etc.

## Course Outline

Today we will start with:

1. An Introduction to `RStudio`
2. Reading data into `R`
3. Manipulating and cleaning data
4. Visualising data
5. Writing reports using `RMarkdown`


## Course Outline

By the end of the day, we'll be able to

1. Load tabular data (.csv and other 'Excel-type' formats)
2. Clean up datasets
3. Edit data after loading
4. Make amazing looking plots
5. Send reports to collaborators made directly from our code

::: {.notes}
We'll cover a little about data types as this is important for R.
Also important for Excel macros
